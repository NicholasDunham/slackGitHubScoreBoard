# Slack GitHub Scoreboard

A serverless Slack integration to calculate scores for members of a Slack team,
based on their public GitHub activity this week. Includes a slash command to
calculate the score of an arbitrary team member, and a weekly scheduled task to
display the top three member scores for the week.

This repo is probably not very useful to you without modification, but more
information about the project is available in my Medium post [Building a
Serverless Slack Integration with TypeScript][1].
